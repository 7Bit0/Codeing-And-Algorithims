The  Enigma  machine  is  a  cipher  device  developed  and  used  in  the  early-  to  mid-20th  century  to  protect  commercial,  diplomatic,  and  military  communication.  It  was  employed  extensively  by  Na i  Germany  during  World  War  II,  in  all  branches  of  the  German  military.  The  Germans  believed,  erroneously,  that  use  of  the  Enigma  machine  enabled  them  to  communicate  securely  and  thus  enjoy  a  huge  advantage  in  World  War  II.  The  Enigma  machine  was  considered  so  secure  that  it  was  used  to  encipher  even  the  most  top-secret  messages
